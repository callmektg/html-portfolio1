<h1>The Best Movies according to KTG</h1>
    <h2>The top 5 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
        <h3>1. Teen Wolf</h3>
            <p>This is one of the best movies i have seen in my life.
                It's actually one of my favourite chilhood movies.</p>

        <h3>2. Game of Thrones</h3>
            <p>This would have been my No.1 but there's a reason for it been a second option.
                There was so much suspense in the movie even though<br /> all of the episodes were not out immediately.
                We had to wait for like a year <br />before the last season came out and it was worth it.
                We all wished the movie didn't end.</p>

        <h3>3. Mission Impossible</h3>
            <p>This is my third best movie at the moment prolly because i can't 
                remember other movies i have seen.</p>

        <h3>4. The Spartacus</h3>
            <p>In as much as this it's a plus +18 rated movie with too much nudity,
                there were some moral lessons i took from the movie.<br /> And i learnt some martials skills.</p>
         
        <h3>5. Assassin Creed</h3> 
            <p>For this i played the game first, before i even knew there was a movie.<br />
                nd funny enough the movie was out before the game and there was a novel.<p>
